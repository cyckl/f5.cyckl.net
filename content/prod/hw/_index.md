## Introduction

If you're in charge of this (Technical Director) then you're in for quite a wild ride. Having implemented the system, I can say that in addition to traditional AV knowledge, it helps SIGNIFICANTLY to have a background in computer networking and some basic familiarity with the nitty gritty of broadcast systems. (standards, real-world implementations, etc)

It'll help you so much if you're willing to dive deep and learn the terminology used below along with getting an idea of how things work underneath the surface. That and you also won't need to call me for troubleshooting as much since you'll actually understand the system.

If you aren't familiar with computers, rope a computer nerd into the program to help yooâ€”it's morally correct.

## Video system

To start, the video system is composed of the following elements:

* [Live switcher](/prod/hw/video/switcher)
	* Switcher control panel
* 3 [cameras](/prod/hw/video/cam)
* 2 [media playout systems](/prod/hw/video/playout)
* [Stream encoder](/prod/hw/video/stream)
* [SDI-to-HDMI converters](/prod/hw/video#Converters)

Most of these systems are connected using two types of connection. The video layer is wired up using SDI and the control layer is implemented out-of-band via Ethernet.

### Audio system

* [Mixer](/prod/hw/audio/mixer)
* [Microphones](/prod/hw/audio/mic)
* [Background music](/prod/hw/audio/music)

Audio routing is accomplished through a mixture of TRS and XLR from input to output. Generally simple.

## Ancilliary systems

In addition, to complement the main system, a few other ancilliaries are included in the rack:

* [Intercom](/prod/hw/ancillary/intercom)
* [Tally](/prod/hw/ancillary/tally)
* [Network-attached storage (NAS)](/prod/hw/ancillary/nas)
* Two [ethernet switches](/prod/hw/ancillary/net)

## External systems

For things not located directly in the production rack:

* [Teleprompters](/prod/hw/ancillary/prompter)
* [Studio lighting](/prod/hw/ancillary/light)
* Tally lights
* Intercom belt-packs

## Everything else

Everything has to be wired up somehow, but it's enough information to necessitate an independent page: [Wiring](/prod/hw/wiring)

Information on the physical rack hardware itself is accessible here: [Rack](/prod/hw/rack)
