# System wiring

Overall, the production system is made up of three different categories of wiringâ€”power, content (video & audio), and the control plane. Wiring is a bit of a mess right now, but [upgrades](#upgrades) are planned in order to simplify wiring for simple setup and teardown.

## Primary signal routing

The production system is composed of a variety of different devices, which culminates in the final package being sent out into the world. This final package is a live video stream, so the signal routing here will cover video and audio.
