+++

The teleprompter system consists of three [19" Magicue Studio](#) prompters. Each prompter unit itself is quite simple, being made up of a computer monitor, reflective glass surface, a camera hood, and mounting hardware.

Set up is easy, with the system mounted in between a camera and its stand. Video signal can be sent to the prompter using HDMI.

## Current setup

In the studio, there is a teleprompter for the [anchors](/content/anchors) (Camera 2) and another for both [sports desk](/content/sports) and [school announcements](/content/announcements) (Camera 3). Each has a dedicated 21.5" iMac running an HDMI signal into it via a Displayport-to-HDMI converter. We use AutoCue, which is linked below.

## Content

With the system running, it's recommended to run some type of prompting software for easy control. There are two major options for now:

* [AutoCue (thank you Matt!)](https://cue.f5.maatt.fr)
* [Promptr](https://promptr.co)

Just paste the script in, adjust the settings, and go.
