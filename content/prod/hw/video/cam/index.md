# Cameras

There is a set of three Sony [PXW-X320](#) cameras in the studio. These are pretty decent cameras, but have a maximum resolution of 720p (or 1080i). Single-handedly the only real bottleneck in the entire system, as the house format is decided by the weakest link in the chain.

They feature plenty of I/O and are technically portable (with the right V-mount battery), but you're limited to being tethered for at least the video signal.
