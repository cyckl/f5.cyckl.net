# Stream encoder

## Setup and management

## Quirks

### No power button

The only way to control power to the unit is to cut power, either by turning off the system in the standard fashion via the power switch, or by unplugging it.

This is dumb. This is also SOP for Blackmagic equipment, apparently.
