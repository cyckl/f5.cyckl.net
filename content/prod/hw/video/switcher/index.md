# Switcher

The currently installed switcher is the BMD [ATEM Constellation 8K](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/atemconstellation8k/techspecs/W-APS-12). These were used for IMAG (image magnification) for Billie Eilish's tour in 2022, and the ATEM line is a popular choice for setups in churches and other budget-conscious environments.

This is the heart of the production. Video sources, audio devices, control data, and more all converge here. Equipped with 40 SDI inputs, 24 customizable SDI outputs, and 4 multiviewer outputs, there's quite a lot you can do with the switcher, provided that you know how to take advantage of it.

As you'll find with a lot of the Blackmagic equipment installed, it can be a little ass-backwards sometimesâ€”provided that you understand how things work underneath, it shouldn't give you too many issues. It's no *Ross Carbonite*, but it's also extremely affordable, so I wouldn't die on this hill.

If you're setting up the switcher from a blank state, use this [guide](/prod/how/switcher-config) to help you.

## Quirks

### No longer able to connect

See also: [*Network switch*](/prod/hw/ancilliary/net) or [*Wiring*](/prod/hw/rack/wiring)

Something is likely wrong with the network connection. Make sure that everything is plugged into the switch and that IPs are set correctly in the software and control panel.

### No power button

The only way to control power to the unit is to cut power, either by turning off the system in the standard fashion via the power switch, or by unplugging it.

This is dumb. This is also SOP for Blackmagic equipment, apparently.
