# Falcon 5 wiki

Welcome to my general resource for the Falcon 5! I graduated as part of the Class of 2023 and only spent about a year in the Broadcast program–but I had a significant impact on the technical processes used on the show.

## Content

See also: [*Content*](/content)

The **Falcon 5** is a school news show that runs every Thursday during your Advisory (a.k.a. Core, Homeroom) period. Content varies, but generally consists of a selection of pre-made segment packages, live school announcements, and a live sports desk. All of this is tied together by the show's anchors, who provide brief commentary and transition from each piece of content to the next.

## Production

The show is tied together by a live switcher system, which is then broadcast to YouTube during Advisory. There are two major people involved in the technical production of the show—the *Technical Director* (controls the video switcher), and the *Audio Engineer* (controls mixing board).
