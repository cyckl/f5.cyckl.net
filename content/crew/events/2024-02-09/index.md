## Arrival process

1. Students either arrive on busses (around 10:00 AM) or are dropped off by parents around the back (close to Stadium)
2. Students meet in the stadium to be sorted into groups
	* About 10 groups
3. After sorting, groups leave in small incremental chunks to begin the tour process
